# Smart-Object-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-and-YOLOv8
This project uses YOLOv8 and OpenCV to perform real-time object detection through a webcam. It identifies multiple objects from the COCO dataset, applies confidence filtering, and displays results with labeled bounding boxes, making it ideal for surveillance and smart monitoring systems.
